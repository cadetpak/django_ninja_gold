From Coding Dojo - Django, assignment "Ninja Gold".

Using sessions (no models!), create a simple game where buttons are clicked to generate a random number of coins.
Each activity will display message with how much gold was found.
Total gold is displayed on top.

Also added "New Game" button to clear session data and start over.
